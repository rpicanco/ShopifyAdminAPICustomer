<ul>
	<li>The system must allow Merchants create customer resource for storing information about a shop's customers, such as their contact details, their order history, and whether they've agreed to receive email marketing. The Customer resource also holds information on the status of a customer's account. Customers with accounts save time at checkout when they're logged in because they don't need to enter their contact information.</li>
	<br>
	<li>The system must allow Merchants generate an account activation URL for a customer whose account is not yet enabled. The account activation URL generated is for one-time use and will expire after 30 days. If the Merchant generate a new account activation URL, then the new URL will be again valid for 30 days, but the previous URL will no longer be valid.</li>
