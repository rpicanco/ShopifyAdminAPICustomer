## About the Project

This project was based on <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference/customers">Customer Admin API</a> from <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin">Shopify Admin API</a>.

## Strategic Design

This section aims at creating all deliverables to clearly understand the problem and proposed solution. It encompasses analysing the business domain, defining bounded context and ubiquitous language, registering architectural decisions made, gathering business and technical requirements, making solution design and artifacts that will support the development teams, such as Swagger and Async API and so on.
