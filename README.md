## About the Project

This project was based on <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin/rest/reference/customers">Customer API</a> from <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/admin">Shopify Admin API</a>.

## Business Domain Design

This section aims to understand the business domain, identifying their subdomains and defining the bounded context mapping using Domain-Driven Design practices. In addition, this section is where we gather the functional requirements and identify microservice boundaries that will be part of the solution.
